## Design system golden tests

The visual regression suite that protects the Apatie design system lives under [`test/design_system/`](test/design_system/).

- Follow the [golden testing README](test/design_system/README.md) for prerequisites, local commands, and troubleshooting.
- Run `flutter test` before submitting a changeâ€”the command exercises golden tests locally and matches what runs in CI.
- When making intentional visual adjustments, regenerate baselines with `flutter test --update-goldens`, review the PNGs created under [`test/design_system/goldens/`](test/design_system/goldens/), and commit them with the code change.
